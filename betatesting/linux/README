Filenames are pingus-YEAR-MONTH-DAY, pingus-current always points to the
most up to date binary. In general the static-binaries will require a CVS
version of pingus from the same date or a date very close to it, you can
update your CVS checkout via:

 cd whereever/you/have/placed/your/pingus/checkout
 cvs update -D YEAR/MONTH/DAY
 
Where YEAR, MONTH and DAY have the same values as in the Pingus filename.
